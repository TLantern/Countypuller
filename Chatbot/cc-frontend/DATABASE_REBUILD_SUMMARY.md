# Database Schema Rebuild Summary

## Overview
The database schema has been completely rebuilt from scratch to support all user authentication and county record pulling functionality.

## What Was Rebuilt

### 1. User Authentication System
- **User Model**: Complete user management with email/password authentication
- **NextAuth.js Integration**: Full support for social logins and session management
- **User Types**: Support for 4 different county types:
  - `LPH` - Lis Pendens Holdings (General foreclosure records)
  - `MD_CASE_SEARCH` - Maryland Case Search
  - `HILLSBOROUGH_NH` - Hillsborough County, New Hampshire
  - `BREVARD_FL` - Brevard County, Florida

### 2. County-Specific Filing Tables

#### Lis Pendens Filing (`lis_pendens_filing`)
- Primary key: `case_number`
- Fields: case_url, file_date, property_address, filing_no, volume_no, page_no, county, doc_type
- User relationship: Each filing belongs to a user
- Indexes: userId for fast user-based queries

#### MD Case Search Filing (`md_case_search_filing`)
- Primary key: `case_number`
- Fields: case_url, file_date, party_name, case_type, county, property_address, defendant_info
- Enhanced with case details and scraping timestamps
- User relationship: Each filing belongs to a user

#### Hillsborough NH Filing (`hillsborough_nh_filing`)
- Primary key: `id` (UUID)
- Unique constraint: `document_number`
- Fields: document_url, recorded_date, instrument_type, grantor, grantee, property_address, book_page
- Supports liens and property transfers
- User relationship: Each filing belongs to a user

#### Brevard FL Filing (`brevard_fl_filing`)
- Primary key: `id` (UUID)
- Unique constraint: `case_number`
- Fields: document_url, file_date, case_type, party_name, property_address
- User relationship: Each filing belongs to a user

### 3. Job Management System
- **Scraping Jobs**: Track automated data collection jobs
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor job progress and completion
- **Error Handling**: Store error messages for failed jobs
- **User Association**: Each job belongs to a specific user

### 4. Database Features

#### Security & Performance
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensure data integrity across all relationships
- **Indexes**: Optimized for fast user-based queries
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate records
- **Proper Data Types**: Timestamps, JSON fields, UUIDs

#### Authentication Integration
- **NextAuth.js Tables**: accounts, sessions, verificationtokens
- **Password Hashing**: BCrypt integration for secure authentication
- **Session Management**: Proper session tracking and expiration

## Migration Status
- ✅ **Database Reset**: All old data cleared
- ✅ **Schema Applied**: New schema successfully deployed
- ✅ **Migration Tracking**: Proper migration history established
- ✅ **Client Generated**: Prisma client updated and functional

## Testing Results
The system has been comprehensively tested and verified:

### Test Coverage
1. **User Creation**: All 4 user types successfully created
2. **Record Creation**: All county filing types working
3. **Data Retrieval**: User-specific record queries functional
4. **Job System**: Scraping job creation and tracking working
5. **Relationships**: All foreign key relationships validated
6. **Indexes**: Database performance optimized

### Test Data Created
- 4 test users (one for each county type)
- 4 test records (one for each filing type)
- 1 test scraping job
- All relationships verified

## User Capabilities

### For All Users
- ✅ Sign up and authenticate
